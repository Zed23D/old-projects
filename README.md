# Number Guess  
This is a code i wrote in my freshman year in college where i was learning python basics!  

## How it works  
- The program picks a number between 0 and 10. 
- The user has 3 attempts. 
- After each guess the programs provides a feedback on wether the guess is too high or too low. 
- After 3 attempts the program prints Better luck next time! The correct number was : {num1}.  

## Example of the output 
Guess the number! : 4
Too low! try higher number :*)
Guess the number! : 6 
Too low! try higher number :*) 
Guess the number! : 7 
Too low! try higher number :*) 
Better luck next time! The correct number was : 8
